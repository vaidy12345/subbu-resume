                            <p>Resilience is often spoken about in corporate circles as a skill, but for me, it became a lived reality—a series of challenges that demanded not just strength, but a deep transformation of self. I share this story on my professional website not just to highlight where I've been, but to show the grit, empathy, and evolution that I now bring to my work.</p>
                            
                            <p>In 2016, I was making strides in my career as a data engineer when I lost my father. He had long battled diabetes, and though he wished to see my soon-to-be-born twins, he passed before that joy could come true. His absence left a gaping void. A few months later, I welcomed my children into the world, feeling the dual weight of joy and grief.</p>

                            <p>As life moved forward, my wife and I received news that our daughter was on the autism spectrum. The uncertainty was overwhelming, and navigating early intervention options was difficult. While processing this, we were hit with another tragedy—my mother was diagnosed with melanoma. We lost her in 2019. She was my emotional anchor. Losing both parents within such a short span was crushing.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Data Point:</strong> In 3 years, I faced the loss of both parents, a autism diagnosis for my daughter, and the global pandemic. But data taught me that outliers often reveal the most important insights—and this period would become the foundation of my greatest transformation.</p>

                    <p>Then, the world was hit by COVID-19. The pandemic compounded my internal storm, but it also became the moment I chose to rebuild.</p>

My physician recommended surgery. But something clicked in me. I remembered my father. I thought of my children. I chose not to be a passive participant in my health.

                            <p>I realized that the issue wasn't just diet—it was lack of physical movement. I started going to the gym at 220 lbs. Slowly, consistently, I built strength.

                            <p>As a data-driven professional, I analyzed my own journey—my physical health, my daughter's dietary patterns, and how data could be used meaningfully to understand behavioral and health needs. This period unlocked new perspectives. I wasn't just solving business problems anymore—I was applying insights to life.</p>

                            <p>I also reconnected with a long-lost part of myself: music. My mother had always encouraged me to pursue Carnatic violin. After her passing, my sister—my second mom—nudged me to return to it. I began teaching. What started as a tribute to my mother turned into a source of immense strength. My students taught me patience, empathy, and most importantly—that every person has a journey. You can only guide someone if they feel you are walking with them.</p>
