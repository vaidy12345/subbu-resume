**[Brief pause for impact]**

### CORE MESSAGE (10-45 seconds)
**[Warm, conversational tone]**

"Hi, I'm Subu. For 18 years, I've been that guy who makes sense of impossible data puzzles for companies like the ones you're probably running. But here's what makes me different..."

**[Slight lean forward, more personal]**

"When life hit me with losing both parents, my daughter's autism diagnosis, and my own health crisis—I didn't just survive it. I applied the same systematic thinking that builds enterprise data platforms to rebuild my own life."

**[Confident, matter-of-fact delivery]**

"Thirty pounds lost in six months. Every health marker improved. My doctors were shocked."

"That's the kind of resilience I bring to your data challenges. Whether it's implementing AI governance across utilities, architecting HIPAA-compliant platforms for healthcare, or building data strategies that actually work in the real world—I don't just deliver solutions. I deliver transformation."

**[Slight smile, human touch]**

"Oh, and I teach Carnatic violin in my spare time. Turns out, patience with data and patience with people use the same muscle."

### CALL TO ACTION (75-90 seconds)
**[Direct, warm eye contact]**

"If you're looking for a data leader who brings both deep expertise and proven resilience to impossible challenges, let's talk. Because some problems need more than just technical skills—they need someone who's been tested and came out stronger."
